# Xcern
Xcern is a powerful tool for bypassing checks and protections in iOS applications. Designed for developers and researchers, it allows you to study or bypass security mechanisms in apps. With Xcern, you can easily hook functions, manipulate memory, and bypass checks such as anti-cheat systems or other protection mechanisms.
